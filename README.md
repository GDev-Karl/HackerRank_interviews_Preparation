# HackerRank Interview Preparation

Welcome to my HackerRank interview preparation repository. This repository contains a collection of exercises and solutions that I have worked on to prepare for coding interviews.

## Structure

Each exercise is organized into its own directory. The directory contains:
- A `README.md` file with the problem statement.
- A solution file (e.g., `solution.py`) with the implemented solution.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the exercise directory you are interested in.
2. Read the problem statement in the `README.md` file.
3. Review the solution in the corresponding solution file.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference for your own preparation.
